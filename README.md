**Tetris**

I made this Tetris using JavaScript, jQuery, and underscore (for templating).  
All is DOM manipulation: the Tetris board is comprised of 150 divs.  
A cool feature of this game is that I also made a [Rails API](https://github.com/golubitsky/tetris_api) for storing high scores!

[Try to beat](http://golubitsky.github.io/tetris/) the high score!
